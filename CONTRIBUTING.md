# CONTRIBUTING

## Contents

* source files: as a template repository, "source files" are ".cls", ".sty" and some related files with other extension names.
* doc files: including all ".tex" files and even "main.tex", which show how to use "source files".
* config files: These files make our development and use of templates more standardlized (e.g. .gitignore, .latexmkrc, .editorconfig).

## History and Maintainers

Thanks to the pioneers in the field of LaTeX thesis template development of Tongji University, [YukuanHu](https://github.com/YukuanHu)  and [SXKDZ](https://github.com/SXKDZ).

* 2019.05.24: [YukuanHu](https://github.com/YukuanHu) (School of Mathematical Sciences, class of 2016) created a [repository](https://github.com/YukuanHu/Bachelor) about his 8th semester and made his thesis template public in it.
* 2019.04.09: [SXKDZ](https://github.com/SXKDZ) (School of Software Engineering, class of 2016) created [tongjithesis](https://github.com/SXKDZ/tongjithesis) (:star: 100+) with various features implemented.

And thanks to [ganler](https://github.com/ganler), who made [YukuanHu](https://github.com/YukuanHu)'s template compatible with XeLaTeX on multiple platforms (e.g. Overleaf, MacOS, Linux) and transfered "overleaf_tongji_thesis" to [TJ-CSCCG](https://github.com/TJ-CSCCG) as [tongji-undergrad-thesis](https://github.com/TJ-CSCCG/tongji-undergrad-thesis).

* From 2021.05.09 to 2021.05.29: [ganler](https://github.com/ganler)
